        <td>A Whisker Away is a 104-minute-long film about the nature of relationships. The film follows a girl named Miyo who turns into a cat whenever she wants to be close to Hinode, a young boy who doesn't share her same level of infatuation. The film is a pure form of escapism born from intensive school life and that first teenage heartbreak. Becoming a cat is an escape to wedge in the anxiety and social issues that occur when being human.
